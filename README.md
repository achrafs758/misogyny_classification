# Arabic Tweet Misogyny Classifier
This project aims to classify Arabic tweets as either misogynistic or not misogynistic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled tweets in Arabic.

The classifier is built using Python and various natural language processing libraries such as NLTK and scikit-learn. The model employs various techniques such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF for feature extraction and uses algorithms such as SVM and Random Forest for classification.

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model can be further fine-tuned by using additional features such as sentiment analysis and incorporating pre-trained embeddings such as word2vec or BERT.

To use the classifier, the user needs to provide a tweet in Arabic as input to the model, which will then output a label indicating whether the tweet is misogynistic or not.

The goal of this project is to contribute to the efforts of identifying and combating misogyny in online spaces, specifically in Arabic tweets.

Usage
1.Clone the repository
2.Install the required libraries
3.Run the classification model
4.Input a tweet in Arabic and it will output a label indicating whether the tweet is misogynistic or not.
Please note that the model is trained on a specific dataset, its performance may vary on other datasets or in real-world applications.
